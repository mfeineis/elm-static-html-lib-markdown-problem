# elm-static-html-lib-markdown-problem
Kind of minimal reproducible markdown problem using `elm-static-html-lib`

* clone this repo
* running `elm reactor` gives the expected markup with `Home` and `Styled`
* running `npm run build` that creates both `home.html` and `styled.html` with the bare markdown source and not the expected HTML
